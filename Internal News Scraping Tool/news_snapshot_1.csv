Because insurance relies so heavily on complex mathematical modelling and high volumes of data, it is an ideal candidate for a
total digital transformation
.
This is particularly true in the commercial automotive space, which represents nearly 1% of total retail expenditure in the US, according to data from Risk Insurance Management Society (RIMS).
Rushil Goel, CEO at Nirvana Insurance, argues that the introduction of AI should do more than simply refine existing workflows.
He says: ""The promise of AI is not incremental; it gives us an opportunity to rethink industries entirely, from first principles and to create the best solutions for the challenges of today and tomorrow.""
The strategy involves placing high-fidelity data at the very heart of the business rather than treating it as a secondary consideration.
Rushil adds: ""At Nirvana, we're building insurance the way it needs to exist in the AI era: with data at the centre, models trained on billions of real-world miles and an OS that can redefine underwriting, claims and services for the industry at scale.""",08.01.2026 13:58
https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/,InsuranceJournal,National News Archives - Insurance Journal,08.01.2026,Feature,"- The article is a national news archive page from Insurance Journal featuring recent insurance-related headlines and topics.
- It covers various news items such as corporate executive moves, auto recalls, legislative proposals affecting automotive safety, and market analysis including predictions for U.S. auto insurance.
- Highlights include CEOs’ salary changes, private equity activity in middle-market M&A, insurance market softening, as well as major recalls by Volkswagen and Porsche.
- The page also promotes subscriptions, webinars, insurance job listings, and industry events.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2026/01/08/853538.htm,InsuranceJournal,German Dentists' Fund Sues Advisers Over €1.1 Billion Loss,08.01.2026,News,"- A German pension fund, VZB, is suing its former auditor, adviser, and managers over €1.1 billion losses from risky investments. - The fund's losses represent half of its assets, which included backing a shrimp farm and investments in various sectors. - VZB accuses Apobank of failing in their advisory duties and Forvis Mazars of providing misleading audit opinions. - The fund also blames the Berlin city government for inadequate supervision of the fund’s operations. - Investments in loans and Schuldschein debt, deemed illegal due to lack of collateral or creditworthiness, were not properly flagged by advisers or auditors.","A German pension fund whose foray into private markets led to losses that totaled half of the fund’s assets has begun legal proceedings against its former auditor, an adviser and its own managers to recover the damages.
The fund known by its German acronym VZB is suing Dusseldorf-based Apobank, the German unit of Forvis Mazars in Hamburg, the Berlin city government as well as nine former managers, according to a court filing seen by Bloomberg News.
VZB, which caters to more than 10,000 dentists in and around Berlin, has said it’s facing losses of about €1.1 billion ($1.3 billion) after many of its investments — including backing a shrimp farm — went bad. It had about €2.2 billion in assets under management at the end of 2024.
The loss is the starkest example yet of a slow-burning crisis engulfing several German pension funds that poured money into opaque and risky corners of finance to prop up returns eroded by years of ultra-low interest rates. Some of those strategies have suffered large losses since rates have risen.
The fund had hired Apobank to advise it on investment risks but the lender violated these duties, the pension fund claims. Forvis Mazars audited the fund and provided VZB with “sham opinions” on assets, according to the filing.
VZB is seeking to hold the city of Berlin liable because the government failed to supervise the fund’s operations as required. It has asked a Berlin appeals court to rule that lawsuits against all 12 defendants can be heard at a tribunal in the German capital.
A spokesman for the Berlin court declined to comment in the case, which was filed in December. As a general rule, tribunals only disclose filings once they’ve been shared with all parties, he added.
Spokespeople for Forvis Mazars and the Berlin government said they weren’t aware of any court filing. Apobank said that while it cannot comment on client matters it rejects allegations the lender was responsible for any VZB losses.
Shrimp Farm
As well as the shrimp farm, VZB made investments that included debt and equity stakes in hotels, vacation resorts and startup companies including digital insurer Element Insurance AG.
Insolvencies of companies that VZB invested in led to losses of €274 million, while separate write-offs on the top dozen investments totaled €791 million, according to an internal presentation seen by Bloomberg.
Roughly a third of VZB’s assets under management were in direct loans and so-called Schuldschein debt, which the pension fund said was illegal due to the lack of collateral or their lack of creditworthiness.
Forvis Mazars and ApoBank, hired to carry out risk analysis, should have raised red flags, argue lawyers for VZB.
“Had the auditor carried out even a few random checks on the large number of loans, it would have noticed immediately and directly, because it was obvious, that the granting of these loans was inadmissible,” VZB lawyers wrote in the document.
ApoBank listed the bulk of these loans as investment grade but never independently verified these ratings or checked whether any writedowns were needed, VZB said.
An ApoBank spokesperson said that as a matter of principle, the bank does not issue ratings or evaluate investments in the area of equity investments, illiquid investments or alternative investments.
“If such investments are held by a client in their fixed assets or free assets, we report the investments, ratings and prices in accordance with the client’s specifications,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News.

- The recall affects multiple brands including SMA, BEBA, NAN, and Alfamino, with no illnesses reported so far.
- At least 37 countries, including Brazil, China, South Africa, and most of Europe, have issued health warnings.
- The recall is linked to contamination detected in ingredients from a supplier, prompting Nestle to test components and source alternatives.
- This incident has negatively impacted Nestle's shares and adds pressure on the company’s CEO amid ongoing management changes.","Nestle’s recall of some batches of infant nutrition products has widened beyond Europe to Africa, the Americas and Asia, including Brazil, China and South Africa, a tally from the company and national food safety statements show.
No illnesses have yet been confirmed in connection with the batches of SMA, BEBA, NAN and Alfamino formula that Nestle has recalled because of possible contamination with cereulide, a toxin that can cause nausea and vomiting.
At least 37 countries, including most European states, as well as Australia, Brazil, China, Mexico and South Africa have issued health warnings over the infant formulas possibly being contaminated.

The recall piles more pressure on the KitKat and Nescafe maker and its new CEO, Philipp Navratil, who is seeking to revive growth through a portfolio review after management upheavals. Nestle shares are down about 5.7% so far this week.
Brazil’s health ministry said on Wednesday that the Nestle recall was a preventative measure after the toxin had been detected in products originating in the Netherlands.
Nestle Australia said the batches recalled there had been manufactured in Switzerland, while Nestle China said it was recalling formula batches imported from Europe.
A notice from South Africa’s National Consumer Commission said that the NAN infant formula being recalled was produced in June 2025 and has a lifespan of about 18 months.
“It was also exported to Namibia and Eswatini,” the commission said.
Austria’s health ministry said on Tuesday that the recall affected 800-plus products from more than 10 factories and was the largest in Nestle’s history. A Nestle spokesperson could not verify this.
Nestle said on Tuesday that it had tested all arachidonic acid oil and corresponding oil mixes used in production of its potentially affected infant nutrition products after a quality issue was detected in an ingredient from a leading supplier.
It is now ramping up production and activating alternative suppliers of the acid oil to maintain supply.

- These rate decreases will affect over 470,000 private passenger auto insurance policyholders in Louisiana.
- The reductions are attributed to a decrease in the frequency of claims.
- The rate changes will take effect January 16, 2026, for new policies and February 13, 2026, for renewals.
- Progressive companies collectively hold about 23.5% of the Louisiana private passenger auto insurance market.","Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple has approved Progressive Security Insurance Company’s request for a 6.6% average rate decrease on its over 270,000 private passenger auto insurance policyholders and Progressive Paloverde Insurance Company’s request for a 4% average decrease on its nearly 200,000 policyholders. Progressive Security’s 6.6% decrease follows a 3.2% decrease the company filed in July 2025.
Combined, the two Progressive companies write approximately 23.5% of the Louisiana private passenger auto insurance market. The changes take effect Jan. 16, 2026, for new business and Feb. 13, 2026, for renewal business. Rate changes are statewide averages, so each policyholder’s rate change will vary based on their individual risk.
Progressive indicated its decreases are primarily driven by a reduction in frequency of claims, the Louisiana Department of Insurance said in a statement.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2026/01/08/853498.htm,InsuranceJournal,Tesla Door Design Is Targeted by New US Automotive Safety Bill,08.01.2026,News,"- A US lawmaker has proposed the SAFE Exit Act, requiring manual door releases on electric vehicles, responding to safety concerns about Tesla's electrically powered door handles.
- The legislation mandates cars with electric doors to have clearly labeled mechanical latches and provisions for first responders to gain access during power loss.
- The bill follows multiple fatal incidents where occupants were trapped due to door failures after crashes, drawing national regulatory attention.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Chinese transport authorities have launched investigations and proposed new safety standards related to electric vehicle door handles.
- Tesla is reportedly working on redesigning its door handles and has added features for emergency access post-collision, but the proposed bill's future support and enactment remain uncertain.","A US lawmaker is proposing legislation that would require manual door releases in new cars, a move to address growing safety concerns with the type of electrically powered handles popularized by Tesla Inc.
The measure from Representative Robin Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, calls for automobiles with electric door systems to include a clearly labeled mechanical latch that is “intuitive to use and readily accessible for the occupant.” It would also require means for first responders to gain access to vehicles when power is lost.
The bill introduced late Tuesday is the first indication that safety risks posed by electrically powered vehicle doors have drawn the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. It adds to the growing scrutiny of electric vehicle doors following a series of incidents in which people were severely injured or died when they were unable to escape their vehicles.
Bloomberg News has reported extensively on modern door systems losing power unexpectedly, including after crashes. The investigation turned up at least 15 deaths in a dozen incidents in which occupants or rescuers were unable to open the doors of a Tesla that had crashed and caught fire. Bloomberg also reported that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk insisted on electric doors even after potential safety concerns were raised internally.

Tesla Door Safety Issues Have Owners Buying Car Escape Tools
“Elon Musk and his Tesla designs are not safe, nor efficient, and it has cost people their lives,” Kelly said in a
statement
that cited Bloomberg’s reporting. “When crashes or power loss leave drivers and passengers trapped inside their own cars, that is not innovation — it’s a safety failure.”
Tesla representatives did not respond to a request for comment. A top executive said in September that the company was working on a redesign of its door handles.
The Securing Accessible Functional Emergency Exit Act — or SAFE Exit Act — is set to be discussed along with several other measures during a
legislative hearing
on Jan. 13 before a House Energy & Commerce committee panel, which has oversight of auto industry issues. It’s unclear how much support the effort has with other lawmakers, and the bill may not end up being signed into law.
The proposed legislation would require rule changes within two years if it becomes law.
Regulatory Probes
Days after Bloomberg’s initial report in September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into whether the doors are defective in certain Tesla Model Y SUVs. The auto safety regulator last month opened a probe into the emergency releases in certain Model 3 vehicles in response to claims from a Tesla owner that they are “hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency.”
In China, transport authorities have proposed new safety standards to address risks posed by electrically powered door handles that sit flush against a vehicle’s body. The designs were pioneered by Tesla but have become commonplace in modern cars. The handles have also attracted growing concerns in the country following high-profile fatal crashes involving EVs made by Xiaomi Corp.
Last month, Tesla updated its website to say that after a serious collision is detected, hazard lights will turn on to increase visibility and “doors will automatically unlock for emergency access.”

- DeFoor allegedly broke windows, vandalized a Secret Service vehicle with a hammer, and attempted to flee from officers.
- He faces federal charges including damaging government property and assaulting federal officers.
- Vance and his family were not home during the incident, and he thanked law enforcement for their response.
- The suspect has a prior vandalism charge and is involved in a mental health court treatment program.","A man who broke windows at
Vice President JD Vance’s
Ohio home and caused other property damage was detained early Monday, the U.S. Secret Service said.
William D. DeFoor, 26, is facing federal charges for allegedly damaging government property, engaging in physical violence against property in a restricted area and assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers, according to the United States Attorney’s office in Ohio’s southern district.
DeFoor was detained shortly after midnight by Secret Service agents assigned to Vance’s home, east of downtown Cincinnati, agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. The vice president and his family were not at home, having returned to Washington on Sunday after a weekend there, his office said.
The
Secret Service
saw a man running along the front fence of Vance’s residence and breach the property line around midnight, according to an affidavit filed Monday. The man was armed with a hammer and vandalized an unmarked Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home’s driveway before moving toward the front of the home and breaking its glass windows, the affidavit says.
DeFoor was detained after he tried to flee from officers on foot. He is accused of causing around $28,000 in damage, the affidavit says.
Public records list DeFoor as living in Cincinnati. Calls to the listings for possible relatives and an attorney who previously represented Defoor were not immediately returned.
Vance expressed gratitude to the Secret Service and Cincinnati police for responding quickly to the incident in a post on the social platform X.
“I appreciate everyone’s well wishes about the attack at our home,” Vance tweeted. “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows.”
Court records show that DeFoor faced an earlier charge of vandalism in 2024 and agreed to treatment under the county’s Mental Health Court system.
The Secret Service is coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department and the U.S. attorney’s office as charging decisions are reviewed, Guglielmi said.
The Vance home is located in one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods, on hills overlooking the city. Throughout Vance’s vice presidency, protesters have often gathered outside the home — clashing at one point last spring with Vance himself.
Vance, a Republican, was
a U.S. senator representing Ohio
before becoming vice president. He moved to Cincinnati after a stint in Silicon Valley following law school, and his half brother
ran unsuccessfully for mayor
there last year. Vance was
raised in nearby Middletown
, which figured heavily in his bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2026/01/07/853351.htm,InsuranceJournal,Good Times for US P/C Insurers May Not Last; Auto Challenges Ahead,07.01.2026,News,"- S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts the strongest U.S. property/casualty insurance underwriting results in 18 years for 2025, driven by favorable private passenger auto insurance outcomes.
- The projected combined ratio for all lines is 96.2 in 2025, with auto insurance accounting for over 41% of P/C premiums, although competitive pressures are increasing in private auto markets.
- Despite near-term success, challenges such as social inflation, litigation, political environment uncertainties, and tariff risks pose ongoing threats to sustained profitability.
- The report revised homeowners insurance combined ratio projections downward and lowered commercial auto premium growth forecasts while highlighting risks like adverse reserve developments in casualty lines.
- Long-term industry shifts, including the move towards autonomous vehicles, require insurers to prepare for evolving risk profiles and coverage needs in the future.","In their latest report on the U.S. auto insurance market, analysts from S&P Global Market Intelligence predict the strongest overall U.S. property/casualty insurance underwriting results in 18 years for 2025, driven by favorable private passenger auto outcomes.
Still, while their 2025 projected combined ratio across all lines is now 96.2, three points better than a midyear projection of 99.2 estimated for the year in August, “success is anticipated to be temporary due to various market dynamics and challenges,” S&P GMI said in a December media statement.
The media statement announced the publication of the firm’s 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Market Report, which stresses the significant weight that auto insurance has on overall P/C insurance industry results.
Historical and Forecasted Combined Ratios and Premium Growth for Auto Insurance (Private Passenger and Commercial). Source. S&P Global Market Intelligence 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Market report
Together, S&P GMI estimates that private and commercial auto insurance will account for 41.1% of total U.S. P/C direct premiums written in 2025 when final results are tallied—slipping down slightly from a five-year high of 41.2% achieved in 2024, reflecting the impact of competition emerging in the private auto market.
S&P GMI projects a 94.5 2025 combined ratio for auto insurance (personal and commercial together), driving the all-lines P/C combined ratio down to 96.2, compared to 96.5 in 2024. This marks the first sub-97 results in successive years since 2006-2007, according to the media statement.
Source.
S&P Global Market Intelligence historical results and proprietary estimates from 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Market report. Data compiled Dec. 3, 2025. (A=actual, E-expected, P=projected; LAE= loss adjustment expenses; state funds and residual markets excluded)
Offering reasons for the industry’s success in 2025, S&P GMI noted the impact of “a generational hard market in personal lines,” as well as a benign year for natural catastrophes. “These factors are unlikely to recur, suggesting that the current level of success may be fleeting,” S&P GMI said.
In particular, the private auto business has seen accelerated competitive dynamics, “with rate decreases matching rate increases and increased advertising spending,” the media statement said.
Focusing on the 94.5 combined ratio projected for the combination of personal and commercial auto lines, the report notes that in the last two decades, the auto insurance business only produced a better result once—93.8 in 2020—when COVID-19 lockdowns fueled a precipitous drop in claims frequency. Even sub-100 combined ratios had been scarce from 2009 through 2023, with 2018 marking the only year other than 2020 with a result below breakeven.
Looking ahead, S&P GMI expects auto insurance combined ratios to breach the breakeven level again in 2028, edging up to 97.1 in 2026 (matching 2024’s auto combined ratio) and 98.9 in 2027, according to the full report made available to Carrier Management.
“Though we project that the combination of the private and commercial auto insurance businesses will post some of their strongest underwriting results on record in the near term, this is not to imply that the market is devoid of risks,” the report says. “Social inflation, or the escalation in claims severity due to adverse litigation trends, has vexed the commercial auto business for years, and recent results suggest that it is becoming a more significant threat to the private auto business—particularly among at-fault drivers with higher limits of liability under personal umbrella policies.”
“The political environment remains a wildcard as elected officials propose and/or implement policies with direct or indirect implications for auto insurance….[T]he generational hard market of the past several years in both private auto and homeowners has prompted calls for revisions to rate filing regimes that are likely to crescendo in 2026 to the extent our projections for continued historically favorable levels of profitability pan out.”
Also mentioned in the report is the tariff wildcard. Even though tariffs received a lot of attention earlier this year, they ultimately did not impact auto physical damage results. Still, future emergence cannot be entirely ruled out, S&P GMI suggests.
(Editor’s Note: Separately, S&P GMI projects a 92.7 combined ratio for personal auto in 2025, and 104.3 for commercial auto. If it actually lands at 92.7, the personal auto combined ratio result “would rival 2020 for the best private auto combined ratio [92.5] in at least 30 years,” without the material changes in driving behavior that accompanied a global pandemic.
Although S&P GMI doesn’t project that the personal auto combined ratio will rise above 100 until 2029, the text of the report suggests that a nearly 3-point improvement in the commercial auto combined ratio could be short-lived. The official forecast is for commercial auto combined ratios to move up slowly—from 104.4 in 2026 to 106.3 in 2029. But referring to historical results that could repeat, the text that a 3.5-point improvement in 2014, was followed by five years of pre-pandemic ratios ranging from roughly 109-111.)
Revised Projections
In addition to auto insurance, the 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance report, published in late December, includes full-year 2025 combined ratio projections for homeowners insurance in personal lines, and for several commercial lines, as well as projections of direct written premium growth for the same lines.
Comparisons to earlier projections delivered in S&P GMI’s 2025 U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance Market Report, published in August 2025, are shown graphically in the latest report on auto lines and set forth below.
The latest combined ratio projections are generally better than the August projections, with the homeowners line showing the greatest change—falling down from a forecast of 106.1 in August to below 100 (96.2) in December. The only line for which the forecasted full-year combined ratio moved in the opposite direction is commercial liability (other liability and product liability), which moved from 107.8 in the August report to over 110 in December.
Previously, the homeowners combined ratio projection had incorporated expectations for another active severe convective storm season in the second quarter and an average hurricane season in the third quarter—neither of which materialized.
“Meanwhile, adverse reserve development in certain casualty lines is running ahead of what we presumed to have been conservative projections,” the report says, commenting on the commercial liability lines. “This is particularly worrisome given that the fourth quarter, when companies occasionally implement “kitchen-sink” reserve charges lies ahead.”
As for premium growth, S&P GMI hasn’t changed personal auto forecast of a jump of about 5% in 2025, compared with 2024, but analysts now project commercial auto insurance direct premiums “expanding at a more sluggish pace” than previously expected. In the August report, S&P GMI has put commercial auto premium growth at 12%, but the forecast now falls below 10%, according to the graphical comparison.
On the personal lines side, S&P GMI has also taken down its projected growth rate for homeowner insurance—to roughly 10%, according to the December auto insurance report, down from 13.1% in the August analysis.
What Else is in the Auto Report
S&P GMI’s December auto insurance report also includes:
A discussion of macroeconomic factors and their impact on the auto insurance business.
Separate analyses of liability and physical damage combined ratios and growth rates for personal and commercial auto insurance segments.
Lists of the top 20 personal and commercial auto insurers, showing five years of direct premiums and loss ratios for each insurer (2020-2024).
Maps providing state-by-state loss ratio comparisons (five-year loss ratios for 2020-2024, presented separately for personal auto liability, personal auto physical damage, commercial auto liability and commercial auto physical damage).
Maps indicating 2025 rate-change relativities for personal auto by state, and cumulative rate changes from 2021 through 2024.
Discussion and analysis of advertising spending of major personal lines direct writers.
Crash frequency statistics for commercial trucks and the analysis of E&S growth in the commercial auto market.
Throughout the report, S&P GMI also reminds auto insurers of long-term challenges on the horizon as the potential shift towards autonomous vehicles requires insurers to plan for a future with different risk profiles and coverage needs.
Conceding that “the promise of full autonomy within the private passenger fleet seemingly remains years away,” the report advises that “no matter how distant the transition, auto insurers have had no choice but to plan for a future that may look very different than the present and past.”

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2026/01/07/853258.htm,InsuranceJournal,MAPFRE Accuses AAA of Violating Long-Time Exclusive Marketing Agreement,07.01.2026,News,"- MAPFRE has sued AAA Northeast for allegedly violating a 20-year exclusive joint marketing agreement (JMA) by selling auto insurance policies through its affiliate Motor Club Insurance Co. (MCIC) before the agreement expires in 2026.
- MAPFRE claims AAA Northeast is improperly promoting discounted auto insurance rates and using the AAA Emblem for MCIC policies, which breaches the terms of the JMA.
- The agreement gives MAPFRE exclusive rights to market and sell discounted insurance to AAA Northeast members, generating over $200 million in premiums in 2025.
- MAPFRE alleges AAA Northeast's actions constitute breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of Massachusetts consumer protection law, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
- AAA Northeast has not responded to requests for comment regarding the lawsuit.","The biggest auto insurer in Massachusetts is at odds with the AAA Northeast division it says is violating an exclusive 20-year joint marketing agreement that is worth $200 million a year in premiums to the insurer.
In a lawsuit in state court, insurer MAPFRE contends that AAA Northeast’s insurance agency has already begun selling auto insurance policies from its affiliated insurer, Motor Club Insurance Co. (MCIC), to its auto club members even though the exclusive joint marketing agreement (JMA) with MAPFRE is still in effect.
According to MAPFRE, the JMA gives it the exclusive right to market and sell to AAA Northeast members using the AAA Emblem at preferential or discount pricing under the state’s group insurance law until December 31, 2026.
But, the insurer alleges, AAA Northeast is seeking to “undercut MAPFRE’s relationship with Massachusetts consumers by improperly promoting and selling insurance” through MCIC starting January 1, 2026 — a full year before the agreement is set to expire, despite MAPFRE giving notice of AAA Northeast’s violations and requesting AAA to adhere to its obligations.
The insurer said the JMA, which has been in place since 2007, generated more than $200 million in premiums for MAPFRE from AAA Northeast customers in 2025 alone.
Under the agreement, MAPFRE pays commissions and a profit-sharing bonus to AAA for all MAPFRE auto policies sold to AAA members by the insurer’s participating agents.
“The extensive history between the parties has been mutually beneficial, with MAPFRE enjoying exclusive rights and AAA Northeast receiving substantial compensation in return,” the insurer claims in its lawsuit. “Massachusetts consumers have benefited from this relationship, as AAA Northeast members have received excellent automobile insurance coverage through MAPFRE at a competitive price.”
The JMA does allow AAA Northeast to sell up to 50% of its business (as measured by policy premium) through carriers other than MAPFRE, but these other carriers may not use the AAA Emblem, nor can any other carrier provide a discount or preferential pricing for AAA members.
The JMA can be cancelled by AAA if MAPFRE starts a group discount arrangement with any automobile club not affiliated with AAA or if the insurer’s AM Best rating drops below B+. MAPFRE is rated A (Excellent) by AM Best.
Documents with the complaint indicate that MCIC has filed discounted group auto insurance rates with the state insurance department. MAPFRE says MCIC first got approval for rates that gave AAA Northeast members a 2% discount. MCIC later refiled to eliminate the 2% discount but cut its rates 67%-84% with a January 1, 2026 effective date.
“For MCIC to offer any discount targeted at AAA Northeast members in 2026 would be a direct violation of the JMA and this deeply reduced rate is a ‘discount’ in everything but name,” the lawsuit contends.
The insurer further claims that AAA Northeast is violating the JMA in its use of the AAA Emblem on its website in relation to MCIC and by having its sales associates advising members on insurance mention MCIC but not mention MAPFRE.
“This entrance into the Massachusetts market is in direct breach of the JMA, as AAA Northeast cannot use its subsidiary, MCIC, to compete with MAPFRE, nor can it use the AAA Emblem to sell automobile insurance in Massachusetts under the JMA,” the lawsuit maintains.
MAPFRE seeks damages and injunctive relief, asserting claims of breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, tortious interference with advantageous business relationships, and violations of the state’s consumer protection law (Chapter 93A) that prohibits unfair business practices.
AAA Northeast has not yet responded to a request for comment.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2026/01/07/853359.htm,InsuranceJournal,Relief But Questions on Agents' Duties to Insureds After Florida Court Ruling,07.01.2026,News,"- A Florida appeals court reversed a $1 million jury damages award against Brown & Brown, a major insurance brokerage, in a case that risked expanding agents' duties to insureds.
- The case originated from Hurricane Matthew damage where sewage backup claims were denied due to lack of coverage, leading to a lawsuit alleging failure to procure adequate insurance and breach of fiduciary duty.
- The appellate court ruled it was erroneous to base damages on a policy that did not cover the loss and sent the case back for a new trial limited to damages.
- The ruling alleviates concerns about overly broad fiduciary duties for agents, emphasizing that agents are not guarantors of coverage for unrequested protections.
- The decision is closely studied by Florida insurance agents and associations, with potential further appeals possible.","Florida insurance agents and brokers can breathe at least a little easier after a state appeals court effectively reversed hefty damages in a case that had threatened to expand agents’ duties to insureds as well as their liability in coverage disputes.
The long-running litigation involved Daytona Beach-based Brown & Brown, one of the largest insurance brokerages in the U.S. The case was deemed so important that attorneys for the Florida Association of Insurance Agents penned a friend-of-the court brief, urging Florida’s 5th District Court of Appeals to overturn a jury’s award of $1 million in damages against Brown & Brown.
The court seemed to agree with much of FAIA’s and Brown & Brown’s arguments, sending the damage award back to Volusia County Circuit Court for reconsideration.
“Brown & Brown is pleased that the Fifth DCA reversed the jury verdict and remanded the matter for a new trial,” Brown & Brown said in a statement released by one of its attorneys in the case, Melissa Murphy of the Porter Wright law firm.
But the nuanced ruling leaves some questions unanswered on the full scope of agents’ and brokers’ responsibilities. The brokerage is now reviewing the opinion and contemplating its next steps.
The case stemmed from Hurricane Matthew, which side-swiped Florida’s east coast in 2016. Houligan’s Pub & Club, and Ormond Wine Co., in Ormond Beach, had relied on a Brown & Brown broker to secure hurricane coverage earlier that year. When the storm hit, the restaurant’s sewage system backed up, causing the pub and store to undergo extensive and expensive cleaning and renovations.
After the disaster, the claim was denied. Houligan’s owners discovered that their Lloyd’s of London wind policy, the only coverage
available at the time, did not cover losses from sewage and microorganism contamination. The owners blamed the broker for the oversight and filed suit against Brown & Brown for failing to procure adequate insurance, breaching its fiduciary duty and negligently misrepresenting the extent of the policy. In short, Brown’s broker should have known that he was not placing the coverage the client needed, the pub owners claimed.
The Volusia County jury in 2024 found in favor of the brokerage on the question of failing to secure insurance, but against Brown & Brown on the other claims. Brown & Brown appealed. At the crux of the appeal was whether the trial court judge erred in allowing the damages. The court looked to its sister court’s 1998 decision, known as
Capell vs. Gamble
.
“…The limited issue is whether the analysis of
Capell
as to causation and damages for a failure to procure insurance claims should extend to breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation claims,” the 5th DCA panel of judges noted in the Jan. 2 opinion, available

Brown & Brown had shown that in 2016, no coverage was available for sewage backup losses for the restaurant, even though such a policy was procured a year later. And Houligan’s leadership had not requested the sewage/contamination coverage, anyway.
The jury’s $1 million damage award against the brokerage was based in large part on the Lloyd’s policy. But the 5th DCA had already determined in an earlier phase of the litigation that the Lloyd’s policy did not provide the sewer coverage.
That was where the trial court went wrong, the appeals court judges said.

“As such, it was error to allow the jury to calculate damages based on a policy that this Court has said does not provide coverage,” District Judge Scott Makar wrote for the appellate panel. “Because this error is not harmless, the appropriate remedy is to remand this matter for a retrial limited solely to damages without reliance on the Lloyd’s policy.”
Pre-judgment interest will also have to be recomputed, the appellate court said.
The case was closely watched by Florida insurance agents. The FAIA’s lawyers, Breck Brannen, Brian Chojnowski and Thomas Schulte III, of the Pennington law firm, wrote in their
amicus
brief that the Volusia judge’s decision to allow the large damage award would expand insurance agents’ fiduciary duties beyond what was reasonable. Unless overturned, the trial court ruling would put agents in the position of having to anticipate an insured’s unexpressed needs and become an all-knowing risk manager for the client—or worse, an unlimited guarantor of insureds’ damage when coverage is denied.
“This is not only unjust, but it also puts agents at odds with other fiduciary duties and raises ethical concerns for insurance agents,” the
FAIA brief
argued. “Certainly, binding an insured to coverage and paying a premium for insurance they did not intend to obtain would constitute a breach of the agent’s duties to the insured. No fiduciary duty would require an agent to substitute their judgment for the insured’s regarding the need for coverage.”
The sewage damage could not have been foreseen or covered, attorneys argued. The Lloyd’s policy was a wind policy, and the sewer backup was due to a confluence of non-wind issues: flooding from the hurricane, a failure by the municipal utility, and a lack of plumbing protections such as backflow prevention valves at the restaurant, the FAIA and Brown & Brown noted.
By law, insureds have a responsibility to read the insurance policy. And the pub’s owner never established at trial how he would have acted differently if sewage backup coverage had been available in 2016, the briefs explained.
The trial jury had based its award on the total limits of the policy obtained a year after the storm, in 2017. Yet, the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury that the 2017 policy had a sublimit of $50,000 for sewer overflow—a more proper yardstick for damages in the case, the FAIA brief and Brown & Brown’s brief explained.
“Houligan’s did not prove its damages or causation for those damages by providing an alternative commercially available insurance policy that Brown & Brown could have procured, which led to a verdict not supported by either competent substantial evidence or the manifest weight of the evidence,” Brown & Brown’s attorneys argued.
FAIA President Kyle Ulrich declined to comment on the appellate ruling until after attorneys have a chance to mull over the subtleties of the opinion. Brown & Brown or the insured pub owners can ask the appeals court to reconsider, or they can ask the state Supreme Court to review, attorneys said.
If the case continues with a new trial in Volusia County, it’s not certain that a new jury will come back with a lesser damages amount.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2026/01/07/853304.htm,InsuranceJournal,New York Regulates Consumer Litigation Financing,07.01.2026,News,"- New York State enacted the Consumer Litigation Funding Act, regulating consumer litigation financing with a cap of 25% on lenders' recovery from settlements or judgments.
- The law mandates plain language contracts, a 10-day rescission period, prohibits prepayment penalties, and restricts misleading advertising and influence over settlements.
- The legislation aims to protect consumers from predatory fees and practices in funding personal injury, tort, or employment lawsuits.
- The law requires consumer litigation funders to register with the state, meet financial stability criteria, and be approved before operating.
- It does not cover commercial or law firm litigation funding and took effect in June 2026, 180 days after being signed by the governor.","New York State has a new law that regulates the industry that provides consumers with funds for living expenses while their legal cases are in process in exchange for a share of any settlement or judgment.
Under such contracts, consumers only pay back the loan if they win their case but the interest rates and charges on the funds are often high. The new law caps what these lenders may take from any settlement or judgment at 25%.
Titled the Consumer Litigation Funding Act (Assembly Bill A804-C/Senate Bill S.1104A), the new law sets forth mandatory contract and disclosure requirements that are meant to ensure that consumers are fully aware of what is in the contracts.
Consumer litigation funders typically offer cash advances for living expenses such as medical, rent, food, and utility bills to people with personal injury, torts or employment lawsuits.
Sponsors of the measure said it is needed because as the financing industry has grown, several “bad actors” have charged exorbitant fees and engaged in other bad practices.
The law caps a consumer litigation funding company’s recovery to a maximum of 25% of the gross recovery of the litigation and prohibits enforcement of prepayment penalties.
The law also requires that all litigation funding contracts be in plain language and guarantee consumers a 10-day right of rescission.
It instructs that these third party funding companies may not influence settlement decisions, mislead consumers through advertising, or refer clients to specific attorneys or medical providers.
The act was signed into law on December 19, 2025 by Gov. Kathy Hochul and will take effect 180 days later in June. It will not apply to any contracts agreed to before its effective date.
The American Legal Finance Association (ALFA) welcomed the law, claiming that it “establishes clear, statewide standards for transparency, fairness, and accountability in New York’s legal funding industry while preserving access to justice for individuals pursuing legal claims.”
The new law only addresses consumer litigation funding, not the higher-profile commercial litigation or law firm funding, which have been criticized by insurers for contributing to lawsuit abuse and driving up awards and insurance costs. Commercial litigation financing is often backed by private equity firms, hedge funds, specialized finance companies, or even high-net-worth individuals.
New York’s consumer finance companies must now submit a registration application to the state and be evaluated on their character, fitness, and financial stability. The application must include a bond and be approved by the state prior to a certificate of registration being issued.

- The legislation responds to wildfire survivors' complaints about delays, denials, and miscommunication with insurers following the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, which have resulted in over $22.4 billion paid on claims.
- SB 876 includes measures such as mandatory insurer status updates within five days of adjuster reassignment, doubling additional living expense limits during disasters, faster payment of replacement costs, and mandatory building code upgrades during rebuilding.
- The bill also mandates restitution to policyholders for legal violations and offers extended replacement cost coverage with regular updated estimates.
- The wildfire crisis highlighted challenges in California's homeowners insurance market, prompting regulatory reforms and calls for sustainable insurance practices amid ongoing risks with the FAIR Plan insurer of last resort.","A bill that promises legislative reform in California to speed up disaster recovery for homeowners and renters through improved insurance coverage and expanded consumer protections was introduced on the anniversary of the Los Angeles wildfires.
The Disaster Recovery Reform Act, Senate Bill 876, would also require a disaster recovery plan from insurers for handling claims effective in emergency situations and it would double penalties during declared emergencies for violations of insurance fair claims practices and settlement law. SB 876 was introduced by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara Senate Insurance Committee Chair Steve Padilla. The proposed legislation is a response to wildfire disaster survivors’ calls for swifter claims payments.
According to Lara, wildfire survivors have continued to report on-going problems accessing their insurance benefits, with delays, denials, and miscommunication from insurance companies at the top of the list of consumer complaints filed with the California Department of Insurance since the January 2025 L.A. wildfires.
Insurers have paid more than
$22.4 billion on tens of thousands of claims
from the L.A. wildfires, according to the latest data from the California Department of Insurance. In a report one year on from the wildfires in 2025, Morningstar DBS Research issued a perspective that called the fires “
a significant stress event
” for California’s property/casualty insurance sector.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association could not immediately be reached for comment.
In another move aimed at relief for wildfire survivors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said a group of major banks have agreed to
extend mortgage relief for L.A. wildfire victims
, as the area struggles to rebuild one year after the devastating blazes.
The CDI’s latest data shows 94% of 42,121 policyholder claims filed have been fully or partially paid, but Lara says more action is needed for successful recoveries and safer communities.

SB 876 would require a “disaster recovery plan” from insurers for handling claims and meeting timelines to be reviewed by the CDI in advance and put into effect in an emergency situation.
It would double penalties during a declared emergency for violations of insurance fair claims practices and settlement law, and require insurance companies pay restitution to policyholders when they violate the law.
The bill aims to address the reported delays in payments from the assigning of multiple adjusters to claims by requiring insurers to give status reports to policyholders within five days anytime a new adjuster is assigned.
It would also:
Expand policy limits for additional living expenses by 100% in a declared disaster.
Expand up-front payments by requiring actual cash value and structure replacement cost be paid quickly following a total loss, with interest payable if late.
Provide recovery funds by requiring a mandatory offer of extended and guaranteed replacement cost coverage when writing a policy, and regular updated replacement cost estimates for new business and renewals.
Apply mandatory building code upgrade coverage at the time of rebuild — not at the time of loss — to account for updated rules.
The L.A. wildfires, which destroyed 11,000 homes, put a spotlight on the state’s already existing homeowners insurance crisis. The fires precipitated moves by several insurers to curtail or halt offering homeowners insurance in the wildfire-prone state, and prompted the state’s insurance regulator to initiate several changes to regulations to fast-track rate requests and use better catastrophe modeling to encourage carriers to return.
Lara took several steps to try and shore up the state’s ailing insurance market, which according to the Morningstar report, have enabled carriers to get premium increases quickly. This reform and others, which includes letting insurers use more modeling catastrophe modeling, are “a move in the right direction to create a sustainable property insurance market,” according to Morningstar, which also cautioned that a heavy reliance on the FAIR Plan insurer of last resort still poses a risk for the industry.

- The court found that the government was aware or should have been aware that the dams were insufficient to protect nearby communities.
- Approximately 14,000 homes within federally owned flood control reservoirs were flooded, many homeowners unaware their properties were within these reservoirs.
- The ruling could lead to compensation for property owners affected by the government's flowage easement and may influence further legal claims.
- The government may appeal the ruling to a higher court or the U.S. Supreme Court, as relief for homeowners appears increasingly possible.","A federal appeals court has ruled that the government is liable for damage to homes that flooded upstream of the Addicks and Barker dams after Hurricane Harvey unleashed more than 50 inches of rainfall on the Houston region in 2017.
A three-judge panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled unanimously earlier this week that the government “was aware or should have been aware” that the dams were not enough to protect nearby communities.
In their lawsuit, a group of homeowners said the dams were built with the goal of protecting Houston’s downtown area downstream, “even at the cost of flooding private lands.” Land upstream from the Addicks and Barker dams are dry most of the time, and many homeowners didn’t know their neighborhoods were built inside federally owned flood control reservoirs which filled to unprecedented levels after Harvey.
It’s estimated that around 14,000 homes were inside the reservoir at the time Harvey made landfall in Rockport as a Category 4 storm then stalled out over the Houston region and dumped record levels of rain. More than one-third of the homes in the reservoirs flooded.
Houston Public Media first reported the new ruling. Daniel Charest, a partner with the law firm of Burns Charest that is representing the plaintiffs, told HPM the decision could help the claims others have made against the government.
“This ruling reinforces that every property owner whose land is subject to the government’s flowage easement deserves compensation for that permanent burden on their property rights,” Charest said in a news release.
The government could either appeal the decision to the full Federal Circuit, or file an appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“There are a few more legal hoops to jump through but relief is now closer than ever,” Gov. Greg Abbott wrote on X.

- Insurers recovered through premium increases and low catastrophe losses later in 2025, but the sector remains vulnerable, especially with rising exposure in the California FAIR Plan.
- State Farm, the largest homeowners insurer in California, suffered $7.6 billion in losses, obtained a 17% rate increase, and scaled back writing new policies.
- Regulatory reforms have enabled quicker premium increases and improved catastrophe modeling, which are positive steps, but reliance on the FAIR Plan presents ongoing risks.
- The wildfires intensified the homeowners insurance crisis in California, leading to political pressure on the state's Insurance Commissioner and policy changes aimed at stabilizing the market.","In a report one year on from the Los Angeles area wildfires in 2025, which started on Jan. 7, Morningstar DBS Research issued a perspective that called the fires “a significant stress event” for California’s property/casualty insurance sector.
The industry remained resilient and the state’s insurance regulator ushered in “positive reforms,” such as allowances for rate increases, the state’s P/C sector remains vulnerable to another significant loss event, which is compounded as California FAIR Plan total exposure grows, the report from Morningstar shows.
Insurers have paid more than
$22.4 billion on tens of thousands of claims
from the Los Angles wildfires that broke out a year ago, according to the latest data from the California Department of Insurance.
According to the report, the U.S. P/C insurance sector recovered from the 2025 wildfire losses thanks to premium increases and low catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year.
State Farm General Insurance Co., the entity writing California property risk for State Farm, was particularly vulnerable and remains in a weaker position, the report shows.
State Farm, California’s largest homeowners insurer, got
approval for a 17% rate increase
following billions of dollars in losses from the L.A. wildfires and a pullback on writing new policies in the state. State Farm
upped its rate request
in May.
The wildfires, which destroyed 11,000 homes, put a spotlight on the state’s already existing homeowners insurance crisis. In another brewing battle over the impact of the fires, a few of the victims of wildfires have
asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom to call for the resignation of California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara

“A year after the January 2025 L.A. area wildfires, the U.S. P&C insurance sector has generally remained resilient, with no failure among the leading insurers in the California property market,” stated Patrick Douville, Morningstar’s vice president global insurance and pension ratings. “However, State Farm General Insurance Company, which is a leading property insurer in California, has incurred $7.6 billion in catastrophe losses and remains in a relatively weak, although stable, financial position. California’s FAIR Plan received a $1 billion payment from the insurance industry in 2025, after it ran out of funds to cover approximately $4 billion in claims related to the L.A. wildfires. With the total exposure of the FAIR Plan growing fast and reaching $696 billion, the risk remains significant for the industry.”

- Atlantic Group will see its founders reinvesting a significant portion of their equity to become Howden shareholders; the deal values Atlantic at over $500 million.
- The acquisition aims to create a global powerhouse targeting leading private equity firms and portfolio companies with M&A protection services.
- This move is part of Howden's strategy to strengthen its US presence and compete with major global brokers like Marsh & McLennan, Aon, Gallagher, and Willis Towers Watson.
- Howden, owned by employee-shareholders and private equity firms, is valued highly and plans an IPO by 2030.","UK insurance broker Howden agreed to buy M&A protection specialist Atlantic Group as the City firm presses ahead with a rapid expansion in the key US market.
Atlantic Group’s founders — Richard French, Joe O’Brien and David Haigh — will reinvest a “substantial portion” of their equity to become shareholders of Howden, according to a statement Monday. The deal values Atlantic Group, which was founded in 2017 and has over 110 staffers, at more than $500 million, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.
New York-based Atlantic helps companies and private equity firms buy protection against breaches of warranties as well as tax and credit risks related to M&A in the US. Howden is already the largest transaction liability insurance broker outside the country.
The combination aims to create a “global powerhouse” that will seek to win business from the “world’s leading private equity houses and their portfolio companies,” Howden Founder and Chief Executive Officer David Howden said in the statement. Barclays Plc acted as financial adviser to Howden, while Piper Sandler advised Atlantic Group.
Take-up of M&A protection has grown over the past decade, a period that saw rampant dealmaking by buyout firms, fueled by low interest rates. The protection can help sellers receive more of their proceeds upfront, while offering buyers recourse.
The deal for Atlantic is Howden’s latest push to boost its US presence as it looks to rival major global brokers Marsh & McLennan Cos., Aon Plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Willis Towers Watson Plc.

London-based Howden is owned by 5,300 employee-shareholders, PE firms General Atlantic and HgCapital, Canadian pension fund La Caisse and the Howden Foundation. The company’s equity was valued at £10 billion ($13.4 billion) in 2024, ahead of an internal share sale. The firm’s enterprise value, which includes debt, was £20 billion.
Howden has long been considered a candidate for an initial public offering. David Howden, 62, told The Times newspaper in July that he plans to have completed an IPO by 2030, without committing to a venue.

- The fire, potentially caused by sparklers igniting soundproofing insulation, killed at least 40 people and injured 119, many of whom are teenagers.
- The investigation includes scrutiny of bar capacity, emergency exits, renovation works, and compliance with fire protection regulations.
- The municipality of Crans-Montana will act as a civil party in the criminal proceedings.
- Swiss authorities emphasize providing medical care and identifying the victims while ensuring law enforcement thoroughly examines responsibility.","Valais public prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the operators of Le Constellation Bar in Crans Montana, Switzerland, after a fatal fire that broke out on New Years Eve.
Following the initial investigation conducted by the Valais public prosecutor’s office, a criminal investigation into negligent homicide and bodily harm and negligent causing of a conflagration was launched late Friday against the two operators of the bar, police
said in a statement
.
The fire, which may have been caused by sparklers igniting the club’s soundproofing insulation, killed at least 40 people and left 119 injured. The injured, many of them teenagers, were moved to hospitals in neighboring countries for intensive care and treatment as Swiss hospitals operate at capacity.
The top priority at the moment is providing the best possible medical care and identifying the deceased, Swiss Justice Minister Beat Jans said at a press conference in Crans Montana on Saturday. On Sunday, 24 of the dead were identified, among them Swiss, Italian, Romanian, French and Turkish citizens between the ages of 14 to 39.
Still, the question of responsibility is paramount, Jans added. “The Federal Council has complete confidence in the law enforcement authorities,” he said, declining to comment further.
The investigation examines all aspects of the incident, including the number of people allowed into the bar, accessible emergency exits, as well as renovation works done on the building and materials used, according to comments by chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud at a press conference Friday.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2026/01/05/853028.htm,InsuranceJournal,Trump's Venezuela Gambit Tests Investor Appetite for Geopolitical Risk,05.01.2026,Analysis,"- U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and President Trump's threats of further action in Latin America have reintroduced significant geopolitical risks to financial markets.
- Despite muted immediate market reaction due to Venezuela's small share of global oil production, concerns remain over broader Latin American stability and its potential long-term impact.
- The move could unlock Venezuela's oil reserves, enticing American oil companies to invest in production recovery.
- Investors weigh the implications for increased defense spending and geopolitical tensions with countries like China and Iran.
- Analysts note that geopolitical risks have become a persistent element in market dynamics, influencing investor behavior beyond immediate supply shocks.","Markets may have shrugged off the audacious U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but some investors warn that geopolitical risks are perhaps being underestimated after Donald Trump threatened further action in the Americas.
Investors held their nerve on Monday, with stocks in Asia surging and oil prices down modestly although safe-haven flows lifted gold prices, after President Trump said the U.S. would take control of the oil-producing nation.
While Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989, Trump’s threats against Colombia and Mexico highlighted the aggressive shift in U.S. policy and brought geopolitical perils back to the fore for financial markets at the start of the year.
“We’re being reminded that geopolitical risks are much larger than some number cast on imports,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research for Asia Ex-Japan at Mizuho Securities in Singapore.
“The case and the question in mind is – Is broader LatAm stability at risk? Then it’s a different proposition isn’t it, the flow-through effects and all could be much greater.”
Analysts and investors said the relatively calm market reaction to Maduro’s capture was because Venezuela’s oil production relative to global output is small and it would take years of investment for production to catch up.
Still, the far-reaching impact of the military actions will weigh on sentiment, although the move could unlock Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and boost risk assets over the longer-term.
American oil companies are prepared to tackle the difficult task of entering Venezuela and investing to restore production in the South American country, Trump said.
“There should be broader geopolitical implications from this event, but in my view, the financial markets are not very efficient in pricing such risks accurately,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia-Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Markets’ First Test in 2026
U.S. and global stocks made a fast start to the new year after ending 2025 near record highs, having notched double-digit gains in a tumultuous year dominated by tariff wars, central bank policy and simmering geopolitical tensions.
The immediate impact is likely to be seen in the defense sector as countries are expected to keep raising defense spending in the wake of Trump’s readiness to use U.S. military force as part of his broader policy agenda. At the same time, the heightened uncertainty around U.S. policies will weigh on the dollar and its safe-haven status, analysts say.
The U.S. dollar firmed a bit on Monday but is coming off its worst year since 2017, dropping over 9% against major currencies in 2025.
For investors, Trump’s actions in Venezuela have also raised uneasy questions about their implications for China’s posture towards Taiwan and whether Washington might push more aggressively for regime change in Iran.
However, Li Fang-kuo, chairman of Taiwan food conglomerate Uni-President
1216.TW
stock investment advisory unit, said investors are not worried that China might attack Taiwan.
“Yes, China has staged military drills around Taiwan, but we’ve seen nothing like the months of escalation we saw from the U.S. (against Venezuela).”
Indeed, some analysts say investors have increasingly become used to Trump’s various foreign policy and military gambits.
Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said the U.S. action in Venezuela is more of a geopolitical bombshell rather than an oil shock for now, noting that unless it threatens the broader supply chain, investors tend to rotate back to rates, earnings, and positioning.
“We’re in a regime where geopolitics has become a persistent feature, not a surprise.”

Why Insurers Use AI to Transform Customer Communication
By
Georgia Collins
December 15, 2025
undefined mins

Christie Chang, Citi Taiwan CEO (Credit: Citi Group)
In 2026, insurers will scale AI to automate compliant customer communications, speed service, cut admin and improve experience at scale for all
In 2026 generative AI could move from pilots to enterprise-scale use in policyholder communications, risk and customer engagement, reshaping the insurance sector’s competitiveness.
Generative AI
has evolved into a foundational technology for the insurance industry.
Insurers and insurtechs are integrating large language models to automate the generation of letters, enhance risk analytics associated with communications and personalise policyholder interactions at scale.
The result could be faster document generation, reduced manual workloads and a sharper competitive edge for organisations that align data governance with AI deployment. This change reflects broader industry momentum as institutions invest in responsible AI practices and scalable platforms to support enterprise-wide adoption for all forms of customer and regulated communications.
Enhancing the policyholder experience with AI
In insurance, AI is accelerating fraud detection within claims correspondence, streamlining Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and enabling real-time customer assistance through intelligent chat interfaces.
While generative models can analyse vast data streams to spot anomalies in claims, conversational AI is now handling routine enquiries about policy updates or renewals, freeing human agents for more complex issues.

The practical payoff is improved processing times, lower administrative errors and higher customer satisfaction in an increasingly
digital
ecosystem.
Christie Chang, Citi Taiwan Chief Executive Officer, emphasised this strategic imperative during a launch. “AI is reshaping how we operate, serve our clients and scale our business. We firmly believe that to be a competitive in this digital evolution, we must think ahead,” Christie explains.
Cheistie adds: “Generative AI can bring new possibilities to the workplace and by adopting new AI tools, we look forward to strengthening our service efficiency and creating greater value for our clients.”
Automated insurance letters and governance
Risk modelling and regulatory compliance stand to gain substantially from the use of AI in generating communications. By using approved templates and data sources, AI helps institutions ensure that automated insurance letters and policy updates meet stringent legal standards.

Simultaneously, real-time regulatory engines can monitor for policy changes and ensure ongoing compliance across thousands of document variations. As governance frameworks mature, firms that embed explainability and auditability into these AI systems will build trust with regulators and customers alike.
The success of these AI initiatives hinges on data quality, access controls and governance. Insurers must invest in data pipelines and model risk management to ensure reliable outputs and auditable communications.
Scaling AI customer messaging for productivity
Operational efficiency will be achieved through AI-powered automation of routine tasks from data extraction for a policy document to standardised reporting. This releases human capital for higher-value work such as strategic analysis, product innovation and client advisory.
Firms that prioritise data hygiene, model governance and upskilling will see the fastest, most sustainable productivity gains from AI technologies. The 2026 trend will be a move from small AI pilots to enterprise-wide programmes for content and communications.
Successful firms will adopt modular AI architectures, embed governance controls and measure outcomes through live business metrics.
Derek Waldron, Chief Analytics Officer at JPMorgan Chase, outlined JPMorgan Chase's ambition on this front.
“Our vision is to make JPMorganChase a truly AI-connected enterprise,” says Derek.
Derek adds: “It’s a testament to JPMorgan Chase's commitment to innovation and our incredible people that we continue to lead the industry in maximising the impact of AI.”
Derek Waldron, Chief Analytics Officer at JPMorgan
For the insurance sector, 2026 will mark a turning point when generative AI becomes a strategic factor in efficiency and customer engagement.
As insurers enhance customer interactions with automated, compliant communications, this evolution aligns with the broader conversations shaping our next private event, Breakfast at Tiffany’s: Reimagining Financial Services Through the Power of AI.

- Adoption of AI tools varies from off-the-shelf solutions like contract management with agentic AI to broader tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot that affect daily tasks.
- Organizations should prioritize AI use cases that deliver the greatest short-term value, such as automating contract management to enhance productivity.
- Change management involves leveraging AI champions or super users within teams to support broader adoption and maintaining ongoing communication about AI's impact on roles and skills.
- Clear goals around productivity and role transformation are crucial for successful AI readiness and implementation.","What were the key topics discussed in your panel session on finance and spend?
One was around how people need to change their skillsets. Any big technology change always has a knock-on effect on the skills you need. I talk about AI literacy. You've got off-the-shelf solutions that you can buy in like a contract management solution that has agentic AI, where you drive adoption as part of your rollout. But then you've got solutions like ChatGPT and Copilot that impact every aspect of someone's day, and that's where you need continuous growth and the right mindset from individuals to adopt it. Those who don't will end up being less competitive in the short term.
How should organisations approach AI readiness?
There's a lot of buzz and noise when it comes to AI. For us, it's about being really clear on what we're trying to achieve – how do you drive better productivity? How do you change the category manager role so they have more time to drive value?
For us, contract management was a key one that could be completely automated and taken out of someone's day-to-day. There's 101 use cases you could go after. It's about prioritising the ones that are going to have the biggest value in the short term.
How do you approach change management when introducing AI tools?
I'm a big fan of champions or super users – people embedded in the teams that are more digitally savvy that can help uplift the rest of the team. But it's also about the constant drumbeat, continually talking around AI, how it’s going to be used, how it will impact people's roles and the skills they need to have.

AI
-driven precision – a combination with serious implications for the insurance sector.
For insurers and insurtechs, identity has become a critical battleground. From digital distribution and embedded insurance to real-time claims automation, every interaction relies on trusted identities and secure access to highly sensitive policyholder and partner data.
As adversaries such as SCATTERED SPIDER adapt and refine their tactics to exploit both human and systemic vulnerabilities, the attack surface for digital insurance
platforms
continues to expand.
Criminals can now weaponise AI to scale social engineering, compromise identities and move laterally across cloud-native environments that underpin modern insurance offerings.
To keep pace, organisations must rethink how they detect, respond to and outpace these attacks, says Zeki Turedi, Field CTO for Europe at CrowdStrike.
For insurance and insurtech leaders, this means embracing AI-native defence, investing in end-to-end visibility across the AI and data lifecycle and treating identity as the new security perimeter.
In this Q&A with InsurTech Digital, Zeki explores the rise of agentic defence, the development of AI Detection and Response (AIDR) and how cross-sector
collaboration
is transforming the fight against modern cybercrime. He also touches on what this means for the future of digital insurance.",08.01.2026 13:58
https://insurtechdigital.com/news/ai-powered-cyber-threats-are-reshaping-insurtech-risk,InsurTechDigital,Are AI-Powered Cyber Threats Reshaping Insurance Risks?,04.12.2025,Analysis,"- AI-powered cyber threat actors like SCATTERED SPIDER use advanced social engineering and rapid privilege escalation to compromise identities and access sensitive systems.
- Key targeted sectors in 2025 included aviation, insurance, and retail due to their critical operations and valuable data.
- Public-private collaboration was crucial in law enforcement actions that led to arrests disrupting SCATTERED SPIDER's operations.
- The arrests demonstrate that cybercriminals involved in extortion and disruption can be apprehended, impacting ransomware operations.
- Businesses are advised to enforce phishing-resistant MFA, secure help desk procedures, and strengthen detection and monitoring to defend against such threats.","Their hallmark technique is to voice phish – or vish – help desk employees via social engineering, where they impersonate employees, provide accurate identity details and convince support staff to reset passwords or MFA.
Within minutes, the adversary is typically able to register their own devices for authentication, access Microsoft 365 and other SaaS applications, cover their tracks by deleting alerts and move laterally across corporate networks.
What makes them unique is both the speed and precision of these operations. Help desks are often targeted to gain access to accounts belonging to IT and security staff, as they typically have permissions to documentation on network architecture, security tooling and incident response procedures.
The group has also gone after C-suite executives' accounts, likely due to their access to sensitive data, communications and other resources that may support data theft and extortion.
Once inside, they pivot quickly, use identity compromise to exfiltrate large volumes of data, escalate privileges and, in some cases, move from account takeover to ransomware deployment in as little as 24 hours.
Their ability to combine social engineering, hands-on-keyboard tactics and identity abuse allows them to bypass heavily monitored endpoints and disrupt critical sectors more effectively than most eCrime peers.
Which industries suffered most from their attacks and why?
In 2025,
SCATTERED SPIDER focused on industries where disruption has immediate, high-impact consequences
.
The aviation industry is attractive to the group because of its reliance on continuous operations, interconnected systems and the sensitive information involved.
Insurers are valuable targets due to the sensitivity of the data they hold and their critical role in financial services.
Retailers, meanwhile, are often exposed due to large workforces, distributed IT environments and the potential for maximum pressure through downtime.
By combining social engineering with rapid privilege escalation, SCATTERED SPIDER was able to exploit identity and process weaknesses in these sectors and turn them into leverage for extortion and ransomware.
How did public-private collaboration shape this law enforcement response?
When law enforcement and private industry share critical threat intelligence and act decisively, cyber operations that inflict real damage on global businesses can be disrupted, such as in the case of the arrests of two members of SCATTERED SPIDER.
What shifts do you anticipate in ransomware operations after these arrests?
The arrests represent a significant blow and will likely degrade SCATTERED SPIDER’s operations in the near term.
More importantly, they send a message: cybercriminals who aggressively extort and disrupt are not beyond reach.
What immediate actions should businesses take to defend against similar threats?
Defending against adversaries like SCATTERED SPIDER starts with identity.
Companies should enforce phishing-resistant MFA
and lock down help desk processes so attackers cannot use them to reset credentials or enrol new devices.
Just as important is detection and monitoring.",08.01.2026 13:58

- Aviva emphasizes the importance of being climate-ready alongside climate change mitigation efforts, aiming to protect communities and reduce future claims.","Insurance industry advances climate preparedness
Aviva
, a global insurance company serving 25.2 million customers across the UK, Ireland and Canada, demonstrates how insurers are extending their influence beyond traditional risk assessment to become active participants in climate resilience.
The company has set ambitious sustainability goals, including achieving net zero by 2040, whilst pursuing broader objectives that create impact beyond its own operations.
Its sustainability approach centres on climate action and social action through collaboration with businesses, governments, regulators and communities.
The Building Future Communities report exemplifies how insurers are using their analytical capabilities to identify and communicate climate vulnerabilities.
The research shows that Hampton Court Palace in London faces increased flooding risk from the Thames and extreme heat, which could affect its historic gardens and the wider West London area.
In Northern Ireland, Giant's Causeway is increasingly exposed to erosion and slope instability, creating growing risks to visitor access as the coastal landmark becomes more dangerous to visit.

Delinea: Cyber Insurers Make Identity Security Mandatory

Art Gilliland, CEO of Delinea
Delinea report finds 97% of organisations report identity security measures influence premiums as insurers tighten underwriting requirements
Identity security controls have emerged as a critical determinant in cyber insurance coverage decisions, with new research from
Delinea
revealing how insurers could be fundamentally reshaping their approach to risk assessment. The findings suggest a potential transformation in the relationship between security posture and insurability, with nearly all organisations reporting direct impacts on their coverage terms.
According to the report, which drew on responses from over 750 security leaders across the United States and the United Kingdom, 97% of organisations said identity-related controls influenced their premium or coverage terms in some way.
Privileged Access Management drives coverage
Among the identity controls that carry the most weight with underwriters, Privileged Access Management emerged as the primary differentiator, cited by 41% of respondents as influencing how insurers viewed their insurability. Identity Governance and Administration followed at 38%, while third-party and vendor access controls registered at 32%. The hierarchy of these controls could reflect insurer priorities when evaluating an organisation's security infrastructure.
The connection between identity security and actual incidents proves substantial. Among organisations that filed claims, nearly half (46%) reported that the incident triggering their claim was either identity-related or caused by a privileged account compromise. This correlation between identity weaknesses and insurable events could help explain the insurance industry's heightened focus on these controls.
Art Gilliland, CEO of Delinea, said: ""Insurers are sending a clear message: organisations must demonstrate strong identity security maturity if they want affordable coverage, or any coverage at all.
""We're seeing a shift from
cyber insurance
being a financial backstop to an audit of an organisation's identity and access posture.""
Rising claims pressure industry
The research documents a year of rising claims and costs across the sector. Some 72% of organisations filed a cyber insurance claim in the past year, representing a 10-point increase from 2024 figures. During the same period, 70% of respondents reported that their insurance costs rose, creating a dual pressure of increased utilisation and higher premiums.
Delinea
The role of AI in security controls has introduced complexity to the insurance equation. A majority (86%) of respondents indicated their insurers offered premium reductions or credits for using AI in security controls. Among organisations whose overall cyber insurance costs decreased in the past year, 64% identified
AI adoption
as a contributing factor.
AI-powered threat detection and monitoring emerged as the most cited premium influencer at 63%, with behavioural analytics and auditing close behind at 59%. These technologies appear to signal to insurers that an organisation maintains sophisticated security capabilities worthy of preferential treatment.
However, the same technological advancement brings new limitations. Some 42% of respondents reported that their cyber insurance policies specifically exclude AI misuse or liability from coverage. This creates a scenario where AI simultaneously reduces premiums through improved security while introducing potential gaps in protection.
Organisations must demonstrate strong identity security maturity if they want affordable coverage, or any coverage at all
Art Gilliland, CEO of Delinea
""Identity-first security is more than just best practice. It's now an underwriting requirement, especially in the age of AI,"" Art says.
Insurer requirements become prescriptive
The path to securing cyber insurance has become more demanding. Nearly all respondents underwent security assessments to obtain coverage and more than half (51%) were required to adopt an insurer's preferred security solution or appliance. This level of prescription could represent insurers taking a more active role in dictating security architectures rather than simply assessing existing controls.
Coverage limitations remain widespread despite rising premiums. Only 33% of policies cover lost revenue, while 45% cover ransomware negotiations or payment. These gaps leave organisations exposed to potential financial consequences even when they maintain insurance policies. Nearly half (45%) of respondents noted their policy could be voided if required security controls were not in place, adding enforcement mechanisms to the coverage requirements.
The research indicates that cyber insurance has evolved from a risk transfer mechanism to a compliance framework that could shape how organisations structure their security programmes. Insurers now function as de facto security auditors, using coverage terms and premium structures to drive adoption of specific controls and technologies. For organisations navigating this landscape, identity security controls have transitioned from recommended practices to prerequisites for maintaining insurance relationships at viable costs.

https://insurtechdigital.com/news/implementation-cop-kpmg-esg-leads-takeaways-from-cop30,InsurTechDigital,KPMG Insights: The Insurance Implications of COP30,26.11.2025,Analysis,"- COP30 discussions showed that ISSB and CSRD regulations are now baseline expectations for companies, with focus shifting to sustainability issues material to financial impact.
- Climate policy discussions have decreased in volume due to politicization, though policies continue to be issued.
- Scientific insights highlight that 7 of 9 planetary boundaries have been breached, emphasizing urgent action before tipping points are reached.
- Challenges remain in quantifying the cost of inaction on climate change at both national and company levels, which is crucial for progress.
- Climate change is already impacting company valuations and financial stability, with organizations like Norges Bank integrating climate risk into investment decisions, though more cross-sector collaboration is needed to fully embed climate costs into financial decision-making.","Interestingly as a result, I heard a lot less reference of ISSB and CSRD in Belem – not because they aren’t important but because they are just part of the baseline for many companies now, especially those in attendance at COP. As I say to all my clients – focus on those sustainability issues that are (financially) material to you – and that will put you in a strong position to embed sustainability issues in to your strategy, driving both value and impact, and the outputs of this will form the basis of any disclosures required
On the issue of wider regulations, the current politicisation of climate in many countries has led to a turn down in the volume around climate policies – albeit many policies still exist and new ones are still being issued. They just don’t make quite as exciting headlines as those being pulled back so we don’t hear about it so much.
Drawing on recent progress since the Paris Agreement, what lessons can we learn from areas where science has spurred successful action and how can these inform efforts on other planetary boundaries?
The UK’s Special Representative on Climate Change, Rachel Kyte, talked at COP30, about the importance of recognising the progress we have made since Paris. That is, we’re heading towards 2.7 degrees warming by the end of the century vs 4 degrees 10 years ago, whilst also recognising how far we have to go.
I was lucky enough to attend a couple of sessions where leading climate scientist Johan Rockstrom was speaking. He talked about the fact that we have now breached 7 of the 9 planetary boundaries, but we still have time for action before we reach the tipping points that will be some hard to recover from. Johan noted the 2 planetary boundaries we haven’t breached are aerosol loading (air pollution) and stratosphere o-zone layer. His view, which I share, is that the world listened to the science on these two challenges. We now must do the same on the other 7.
I believe COP30 is a great example of how storytelling is so important. As humans we naturally lean out of threats so we need to frame returning back over these boundaries as a challenge rather than a threat. Threats are what make headlines, but we need to come together as society and work out how we can win this challenge – in a way that drives growth in prosperity in all ways.
How can companies and governments improve their ability to quantify the cost of inaction on climate change at both national and organisational levels?
In a COP30 session I joined with Brazilian Ambassador Tatiana Rosito she noted that not being able to quantify the cost of inaction, at a company and country level, was the biggest challenge of COP30. I couldn’t agree more – and I think being able to work this out better will be a hugely positive tipping point for our progress in the challenge against the planetary boundaries. At KPMG International, we’re working with the WBCSD and across the profession to try and solve this. Ultimately, this is where the accountants and finance community need to step up and do our bit.
How is climate change impacting company valuations and financial stability, and how can that be incorporated into decision-making?
There is clear evidence that it is already impacting valuations. In regions like California and whole countries including Australia, we’re seeing a direct link between the growth threat of climate change and valuations of property and insurance premiums. In the US, fairly conservative estimates predict that future wildfires will cost the country at least $400 billion every year. Norges Bank is a great example of one financial institution that regards climate risk as a clear financial risk to its investment portfolio. The bank, as a matter of course, constantly interrogates climate change scenario planning and climate impact in its investment planning and it’s doing it for prudent, practical reasons rather than being driven by any moral obligations. In short, as one executive of a Fortune 50 company put it: “nature is a multi-trillion-dollar subsidy to humanity which we haven’t yet worked out how to value”. However, as a finance profession, we are still working out how to bring this down to the company level. These are the kind of issues we at KPMG International are working on with WBCSD and across the profession, but we have some way to go before the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change are wholly reflected in company valuations and we will need to challenge the status quo, working cross-sector and cross-profession to better reflect the cost of inaction in to strategic decision making at a country and company level.",08.01.2026 13:58

GFT & FICO Form Global Partnership to Combat Financial Fraud
GFT Technologies and FICO launch global partnership deploying AI-powered fraud detection as financial crime losses exceed US$12.5bn in the United States
Financial fraud continues to rise across developed markets. In the United States, losses reached US$12.5bn in 2024, while online crime generated US$16.6bn in damages. European payment fraud exceeded €2bn (US$2.3bn) during the first six months of 2023 alone.
These escalating figures have prompted financial institutions to seek more sophisticated defence mechanisms, increasing demand for advanced technologies capable of identifying and preventing fraudulent activity before it impacts customers and businesses.
As criminals deploy increasingly complex tactics, the industry faces mounting pressure to modernise its approach to risk management and fraud prevention.
GFT Technologies
has formed a partnership with
FICO
to address these threats through artificial intelligence and real-time decision systems. The collaboration combines GFT's capabilities in cloud computing and digital banking with FICO's platforms for fraud detection, credit risk assessment and decision management.
This alliance could signal a change in how financial institutions approach the growing challenge of protecting customer assets and maintaining trust in digital transactions.
Marco Santos, Global CEO, GFT
Real-time analytics across Asia
The partnership has completed initial deployments across two continents. A digital bank in Asia implemented FICO's real-time analytics to support rapid decision-making and risk controls. GFT and FICO established digital onboarding systems, identity verification processes and continuous monitoring throughout customer relationships.
""This partnership reflects what the market needs most: speed, trust, and intelligence at scale,"" says Marco Santos, Global CEO of GFT. ""Together with FICO, we are helping institutions around the world rethink how they respond to risk and deliver better, safer experiences for their customers.""
FICO
Decision management for insurers
In Latin America, GFT deployed demand management systems for a large insurance company using FICO Platform's decision engine. The implementation enabled the insurer to classify and prioritise projects based on strategic data and defined parameters, directing resources towards initiatives with measurable returns.
The alliance will integrate GFT's Wynxx platform, which automates phases of software development. Wynxx analyses data patterns and identifies hidden insights before processing through FICO solutions.
This system covers decision orchestration, fraud detection, credit risk management and customer communications across the entire customer lifecycle.
Global protection through technology
“Our innovations combine machine learning, 360-degree views of customer behaviour, and decision optimisation to power smarter decisions that detect fraud earlier and build customer trust""
Alexandre Graff, FICO vice president for Global Partners & Alliances
FICO currently protects more than 4 billion payment accounts worldwide through its fraud prevention systems. The company's technology combines machine learning with customer behaviour analysis and decision optimisation to identify fraudulent activity before transactions completed.
GFT has established a Centre of Excellence dedicated to FICO technologies. The facility will train technical teams and support standardised deployments across banking and insurance sectors in multiple markets.
Financial institutions gain access to integrated systems that handle identity verification at onboarding and maintain continuous monitoring as customer relationships develop. Banks can establish rules-based frameworks that operate in real time without introducing delays in transaction processing or manual review steps.
Insurance companies can apply the same decision frameworks to policy management and claims processing, establishing systems that prioritise resources based on risk levels and strategic objectives.
Alexandre Graff, Vice President for Global Partners & Alliances, FICO
​​​​​​​""FICO's solutions include a category leader in fraud prevention, protecting more than 4 billion payment accounts worldwide,"" says Alexandre Graff, FICO Vice President for Global Partners & Alliances.
""Our innovations combine machine learning, 360-degree views of customer behaviour, and decision optimisation to power smarter decisions that detect fraud earlier and build customer trust. Our partnership with GFT will bring this power to more businesses worldwide, helping them protect their customers in an increasingly dangerous online world.""

https://www.insurancejournal.com/members/pro,InsuranceJournal,Subscribe to IJ Pro | Insurance Journal,,News,#NAME?,"""Throughout the years I've found the information received to be extremely helpful in making business decisions. Examples of losses that I can share with insureds and prospective clients, carriers that I wouldn't have thought of using, introducing a new product or a desire to write a line of business that they weren't competitive in writing previously. I find the on-line Journal informative, interesting, and beneficial.""
